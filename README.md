# Data-ID Mapper

This app generates a batch of unique 8-digit character/number strings to use as unique identifiers/keys (or whatever else). That's all... just a simple tool for everybody who's tired of coming up with id's or data-sets for your objects and attributes... like me ;)

Click any generated key to clipboard-copy and mark as used.

# Version 1.2.1

- Updated the output field to implicit grid, optimizing responsiveness.
